# Inspiration
We found inspiration in the idea of using IoT to help people with their lifestyle and health.

# What it does
This project is a web application that helps the elderly and the forgetful remember to take their medication.
It is a tool used by doctors to have a system where they can input patient information such as how much of a dosage they should take
and when they should take it. This web application is also meant to linked up to a medication dispenser that will dispense medication into a tray when it is the prescribed time. This device will also use an IoT sensor to detect whether the medication is running low, and it will use the Zang API to contact the patient.

# How we built it
We use the Zang API to allow our application to send an SMS and Call directly to the elderly people and or their care takers who don't have access to smartphones. We used Python to power the backend of the application and to use the Zang API. We also used MySQLdb to manage a database that takes inputs from our website.

# Challenges we ran into
Our most difficult challenge was communication between the different services we were using. We had to come up with a way to connect the front and back-end of our system, and fortunately using database technology we were able to bring it all together.

# Accomplishments we're proud of
We really liked learning new things such as web development and design.

# What we learned
We learned how to use the Zang API as well as font-end development.

# What's next for Dyspense
First step would be actually putting the device together and testing it in real world scenarios.
